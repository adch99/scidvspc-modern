Quoting Lewis Stiller from an e-mail exchange dated 10/01/2017: "CQL is
covered under the GPL because it links to Shane Hudson's parser, which
is GPL. So you're welcome to use CQL in a GPL application. If you want a
less restrictive license for that parts of CQL not including his parser,
I'd be happy to grant that too."

Minor modifications were made to a few of the source files in the porting
process, and may be attributed to Lionel Hampton, who makes no claim of
Copyright to anything in this directory.

A copy of the GPL may be found in the file COPYING in the root of the
