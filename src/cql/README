This directory contains the ported source for the integrated CQL search
engine, as incorporated into the Scidvspc chess database application.
In addition to the integrated engine, a ported stand-alone executable
may be built from the same source.

To make the standalone scql executable, which compiles against native
headers and links with native objects, from the root of the source tree:
    make scql

For licensing details see the file COPYING in this directory.

For documentaion of the porting process see the file PORT.

Many thanks go to Stiller and Costeff for their innovative work on CQL.
It was a landmark development in the world of chess and is a highly
appreciated feature addition to the Scidvspc.
