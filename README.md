# Scid vs PC (Modern)

Shane's Chess Information Database is a powerful Chess Toolkit,
with which one can create huge databases, run chess engines,
and play casual games against the computer or online with the
FICS. It was written originally by Shane Hudson, and has received
strong contribution from Pascal Georges and others.

[Scid vs PC][1] began with bug fixes for the computer versus player
features of Scid (hence the name), but has evolved into a solid
alternative with many new features and interfaces. The project is
authored by [Stevenaaus][2] and [numerous contributors][3].

Scid vs PC (modern) is my (adch99's) fork of Scid vs PC, where I
have tried to make some small changes to the interface as I was
not very happy with it. All major development takes place on
[Stevenaaus's fork][1] only, and you should rely on it for stuff.
